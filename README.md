### Task: Create `paper-container` class and split CSS stylesheet into desktop and mobile versions

* Created the `paper-container` class and added corresponding styles in the CSS file.
* Split the original CSS stylesheet into two parts: desktop and mobile.
* Optimized styles in the `paper-container` class to ensure proper display on mobile devices.
